# Python-Projects
Made in PyCharm and VSCode IDEs (personally), as part of my programming enterprises. It includes projects such as a Geography Game, a Math Game (simple), an inbuilt calculator (with GUI), a BMI and quadratic root solver. As part of recent work, it also includes SQL and SQlite integrated programmes as well (DBMS), in a CRM and ATM application.
